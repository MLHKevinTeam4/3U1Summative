# 3U1Summative
This is my tower defense game final summative for the course ICS3U1!

To run this file, you'll need Python 3.2.5 or 3.6.4 (versions currently confirmed to be working). Compatibility for others is unknown.
You'll also need pygame 1.9.3 (once again, only one tested to work). They have some nice installers on their website, but 'pip install pygame' works too!
